    description: `Nikola is by far our most mechanically
  comblex robot. It uses a holonomic 
  mecanum drivebase to traverse the 
  game field, and a 2-joint arm, along
  with a linear-slide based claw, 
  which allows Nikola to manipulate 
  game pieces. Finally, Nikola has a 
  pneumatic foot subsystem, which pushes
  a textured rubber brake into the ground,
  stopping the robot from moving, even
  on slanted surfaces.`,

    description: `Kronos used a holonomic drivebase to
  navigate the field with ease,
  and a multiple chain-driven axles,
  which were capable of intaking game
  pieces, and shooting them into the air,
  to score points. Secondarily, Kronos used
  a Limelight 2+ to track parts of the game field,
  and align the robot with targets.
  Finally, it used a climbing mechanism to
  score points in the endgame.`,
