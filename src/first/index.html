            <h3>Mission</h3>
            
            <p>The mission of&nbsp;<em>FIRST<sup>Â®</sup></em>&nbsp;is to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders and innovators, by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering, and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership.</p>
            
            <h3><br>
            Vision</h3>
            
            <blockquote>
            <p><em>"To transform our culture by creating a world where science and technology are celebrated and&nbsp;where young people dream of becoming science and technology leaders."</em>&nbsp; Dean Kamen, Founder</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <h3><br>
            Methodology</h3>
            
            <p>Engage <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/about/at-a-glance">PreK-12 (ages 4-18)&nbsp;students</a> in exciting, mentor-based, research and robotics programs that help them become science and technology leaders, as well as well-rounded contributors to society.</p>
            
            <p><em>FIRST</em> works because our programs use strategies known to increase student interest in STEM: hands-on learning, working as a team on real-life problems, exposure to careers and adult mentors, emphasis on <em>FIRST</em> Core Values, and a culminating celebration where students can showcase what they created and learned.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            <em>FIRST</em> participants also develop skills in teamwork, problem solving, and communication, preparing them for success in school and the workforce, no matter what path they take.</p>
